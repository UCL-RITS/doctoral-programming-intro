    "We have introduced three new functions here and corresponding Python types. The `plt.figure` function instructs Matplotlib to create and return a new [`Figure` object](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/usage.html#figure) which holds all of the elements corresponding to a single figure, such as one or more plot axes and other elements such as an overall figure title. The `plt.figure` function takes various optional arguments; here we pass a tuple of the figure dimensions in inches `(width, height)` as the `figsize` keyword argument. Note that the actual displayed size of the plot on screen will also depend on the resolution of your display, this can be adjusted for by also specifying the optional `dpi` (dots per inch) keyword argument to `plt.figure`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Figure` object is itself mainly just a container with its main function to allow adding the [`AxesSubplot` objects](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/usage.html#axes) on which we will actually produce plots. A simple way to add an axes to a `Figure` instance is using the `add_subplot` method which returns an `AxesSubplot` object. This optionally takes arguments to specify the number and location of plots when adding multiple axes to a single figure, however here we only require a single axes so we just call `add_subplot` on the `Figure` object `fig` we created in the previous line without any arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `AxesSubplot` object exposes various methods for actually producing plots. One of the more generally useful methods is `plot`, which is almost identical to the `plt.plot` function we encountered previously. The value returned by `ax.plot` is a list of `Line2D` instances corresponding to the plotted line(s): in this case we plotted only one line so the list has only one element. The `Line2D` object can be used to update or access the properties of the plotted line after the initial `ax.plot` call.\n",
    "\n",
    "As creating a figure and adding a subplot (axes) to it is such a common operation, Matplotlib provides a function `plt.subplots` which combines the functionality of the `plt.figure` and `fig.add_subplot` functions. The `plt.subplots` function as the name suggests can be used to generate multiple subplots on a single figure (we will demonstrate this in the following section) but with its default arguments will just generate a figure with a single axes. Keyword arguments to `plt.figure` will be passed through from `plt.subplots` so for example we can set the figure size by specifying the `figsize` argument. The `plt.subplots` function returns a pair of objects the first of which is the `Figure` object and the second the one or more `AxesSubplot` instances created. We can therefore recreate the above plot as follows."

When we iterate over a NumPy array we return the array *slices* corresponding to indexing only the first dimension. As the first dimension for the `axes` object returned by `plt.subplots` corresponds to the row, a for loops of the form `for axes_row in axes:` will loop over each row of axes. In our case as each row contains three columns, the `axes_row` object will itself be another (one dimensional) NumPy array, with the leading (and only) array dimension now corresponding to the column index. To access the individual axes in each row we can *nest* a further loop which iterates over the elements in `axes_row`. For example, the following cell plots the identity function on all axes."

In this case we might to decide to plot multiple lines corresponding to different coefficient values on a single subplot. We can add multiple lines to a subplot by making multiple calls to the `AxesSubplot.plot` method. By default each successive plot [will cycle through a sequence of ten colours](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/color_cycle_default.html).

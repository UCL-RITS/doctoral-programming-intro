    "[GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) is a JSON-based file format for sharing geographic data. One example dataset available in the GeoJSON format is the [<abbr title=\"United States Geological Survey\">USGS</abbr> earthquake catalog](https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/earthquake-hazards/earthquakes). A [web service *application programming interface* (API)](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/) is provided for programatically accessing events in the earthquake catalog. Specifically the `query` method allows querying the catalog for events with the [query parameters](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/#parameters) passed as `key=value` pairs.\n",

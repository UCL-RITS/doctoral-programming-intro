    "\n",
    "MATLAB has typically been the most popular \"language of technical computing\", with strong built-in support for efficient numerical analysis with matrices (the *mat* in MATLAB is for matrix, not maths), and plotting.\n",

    "But Python users developed three critical libraries, matching the power of MATLAB for scientific work:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), a plotting library for creating visualizations in Python.\n",
    "* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), a fast numeric computing library offering a flexible *n*-dimensional array type.\n",
    "* [IPython](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html), an interactive Python interpreter that later led to the [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) interface.\n",

    "In general NumPy will try to return *views* to the same underlying array data buffer when performing indexing and slicing operations, where possible. These views share the same underlying data in memory with the original array, and so make such indexing operations cheap in both memory usage and computational cost (by avoiding unnececssary copies). As we saw above however, if we assign to a slice we will therefore also update the original array. We can use the `np.copy` function or corresponding `ndarray.copy` method to force creation of an array referencing a new copy of the underlying data"

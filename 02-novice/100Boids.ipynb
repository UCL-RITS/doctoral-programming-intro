We will also fix the initial state of the random number generator by explicitly specifying a *seed* value, meaning we can reproduce our results.

As we have assumed our boids exist in two-dimensions, we can use Matplolib's extensive range of plotting functions for two-dimensional data. Ideally we want to represent both the instantenous positions and velocities of the boids in our visualisation. We will use a [Matplotlib *quiver* plot](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.quiver.html) to do this, representing each boid as an arrow located on the plot axes at a point corresponding to its simulated position, and with the direction of the arrow representing its current heading. While we could also represent its speed by the size of the arrow, we choose here to keep the arrows all the same size - this requires calculating the *unit vectors* (vectors of length one) corresponding to the velocity vectors, which can be done efficiently with broadcasted array operations in NumPy. We wrap the code for plotting the boids into a function to allow for easy reuse. We return the generated Matplotlib figure and axis (subplot) objects, along with *artist* object representing the quiver plot arrows returned by the `quiver` call, to allow us to make calls to these objects outside of the function."

The *alignment* rule specifies that nearby flockmates should tend to match velocities with each other. We can implement this as a force which is negatively proportional to the velocity differences between pairs of boids within a certain distance of each other. We can use a similar implementation to that for `separation_force`:"

    "\n",
    "Hopefully this example has illustrated the power and convenience of NumPy. Implementing an equivalent model using native Python data structures such as lists to represent the states of the boids would both result in code that was slower to run and harder to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in exploring this model further here are some ideas for extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Currently the cohesion force applies globally rather than only acting locally on boids within a certain distance of each other like the other two forces. Can you alter the implementation to have a similar behaviour of only acting over a finite distance?\n",
    "  * There are various model parameters such as the relative force strengths `cohesion_strength`, `separation_strength` and `alignment_strength` which are currently left as the default values specified in the force function definitions. Can you redesign the `simulate_timestep` and/or `animate_flock` to allow passing in a dictionary of these parameter values to override the default to allow easily visualising the behaviour for different parameters?\n",
    "  * Currently our boids exist in a two-dimensional world - can you alter the simulation to work in three-dimensions? You may find [Matplotlib's three-dimensional plotting toolkit](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/toolkits/mplot3d.html) useful for the visualisation side.\n",

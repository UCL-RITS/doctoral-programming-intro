This is the second part of the *Introduction to research programming with Python* course.

This course introduces the basics of creating and interacting with scientific Python libraries such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). 
If you are familiar with the basics of programming (variables, loops and functions) then this course offers you the next step â€“ how to structure your code and organise it into modules.

### This session will cover:

1. Getting data from the internet
2. Tabular and structured data files
3. Classes and object-oriented programming
4. Array-based programming with NumPy
5. Creating more complex visualisations with Matplotlib
6. Installing Python packages
7. Writing your own Python packages
    
### By the end of this course you will be able to:

1. Install Python packages
2. Work with different data formats and know which one is better for your research problem
3. Create modules to group functions together
4. Structure your code using classes
5. Visualise your data in different ways
6. Analyse and manipulate data using the power of NumPy

    "*Comma separated variable* (CSV) files can only store *tabular data* in which all records share the same fields and each field is a simple data type such as a string or number. We often want to store data which has a more complex *hierarchical structure*, for example data in which the fields in each record are themselves structured objects. Structured data formats like [JSON](#JSON), [YAML](#YAML) and [XML](#XML) are designed for this.\n",

    "A very common structured data format is [*JavaScript Object Notation* (JSON)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON). As the name suggests this a JavaScript based format for storing data objects. JSON allows us to represent hierarchical data with a [tree-like structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) by nesting sequence-like *arrays* (analogous to Python `list` objects) and mapping-like *objects* (analagous to Python `dict` objects), with the 'leaves' of the tree being one of a small set of simple data types: \n",

    "  * *number*: a signed decimal number potentially using [E notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation#E_notation), for example `12`, `0.58`, `6.022e23`. Unlike Python no distinction is made between integer and floating-point values.\n",
    "  * *string*: a sequence of [Unicode characters](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/) delimited with double quotation marks, for example `\"Hello world\"`, `\"\"`, `\"üòÄüòÑüòÅ\"`. Unlike Python, single quotation marks cannot be used as the delimiters instead.\n",
    "  * *boolean*: one of the literals `true` or `false`. Note the difference in capitalisation from the equivalent Python values.\n",
    "  * `null`: an empty value, comparable to `None` in Python.\n",
    "  \n",
    "JSON *arrays* are ordered sequences of zero or more elements, and like Python lists are delimited with square brackets with comma separated values. Also like Python lists each element in the array can be of a different type, with the allowable types being the any of the four simple types described above, arrays or objects (see following).\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON *objects* are *key-value* mappings in which the keys are strings and the values may be any of the simple data types above, arrays or objects. As with Python dictionaries, the keys within each object must be unique, and also like Python dictionaries objects are delimited with curly braces, with each key-value pair comma-separated and a colon used to separate the key from the following value.\n",

As this means PyYAML can construct Python objects which may execute code on loading, loading YAML files from untrusted sources can be a [security concern](https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation#loading-yaml). It is therefore recommended to use `yaml.safe_load` to load YAML files when you are unsure about their source as this removes the risk of arbitrary code execution (with the tradeoff of no longer being able to encode any Python object).

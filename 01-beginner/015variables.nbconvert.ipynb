    "In Jupyter terminology the Python process in which we run the code in a notebook in is termed a _kernel_. The _kernel_ stores the variable names and referenced objects created by any code cells in the notebook that have been previously run. The `Kernel` menu in the menu bar at the top of the JupyterLab interface has an option `Restart kernel...`. Running this will restart the kernel currently being used by the notebook, clearing any currently defined variables and returning the kernel to a 'clean' state. As you cannot restore a kernel once restarted a warning message is displayed asking you to confirm you wish to restart.\n",

    "Cells do **not** have to be evaluated in the order they appear in a notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we go back to the code cell above with contents `number = number + 1`, and run it again, with <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd> then `number` will change from 2 to 3, then from 3 to 4. Try it! \n",
    "\n",
    "However, running cells out of order like this can make it hard to keep track of what values are currently assigned to variables. It also makes it difficult to reproduce computations as getting the same output requires rerunning the cells in the same order, and it will not always be possible to reconstruct what the order used was. \n",
    "\n",
    "The number in square brackets in the prompt to the left of code cells, for example `[1]:` indicates the position in the overall cell run order of the last run of the cell. While this allows establishing if a cell last ran before or after another cell, if some cells are run multiple times then their previous run counter values will be overwritten so we lose information about the run order.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general if you are using notebooks in your own research you should try to make sure the notebook run and produce the desired outputs when the cells are executed sequentially from top to bottom. The `Kernel` menu provides an option to restart the current kernel and run all cells in order from top to bottom. If you just want to run a subset of the cells there is also an option to restart and run all cells from the top to the currently selected cell. The commands are useful for checking that a notebook will produce the expected output and run without errors when the cells are executed in order."

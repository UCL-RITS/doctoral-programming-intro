    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why teach Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "* In this first session, we will introduce [Python](http://www.python.org).\n",
    "* This course is about programming for data analysis and visualisation in research.\n",
    "* It's not mainly about Python.\n",
    "* But we have to use some language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python has a readable [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)) that makes it relatively quick to pick up.\n",
    "* Python is popular in research, and has lots of libraries for science.\n",
    "* Python interfaces well with faster languages.\n",
    "* Python is free, so you'll never have a problem getting hold of it, wherever you go.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why write programs for research?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Not just labour saving.\n",
    "* Scripted research can be tested and reproduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sensible input - reasonable output\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs are a rigorous way of describing data analysis for other researchers, as well as for computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational research suffers from people assuming each other's data manipulation is correct. By sharing _readable_, _reproducible_ and _well-tested_ code, which makes all of the data processing steps used in an analysis explicit and checks that each of those steps behaves as expected, we enable other researchers to understand and assesss the validity of those analysis steps for themselves. In a research code context the problem is generally not so much _garbage in, garbage out_, but _sensible input, reasonable output_: 'black-box' analysis pipelines that given sensible looking data inputs produce reasonable appearing but incorrect analyses as outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Many kinds of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "A particularly easy way to get started using Python, and one particularly suited to the sort of exploratory work common in a research context, is using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/https://jupyter.org/) notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a notebook, you can easily mix code with discussion and commentary, and display the results outputted by code alongside the code itself, including graphs and other data visualisations. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example if we wish to plot a figure-eight curve ([lemniscate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemniscate_of_Gerono)), we can include the parameteric equations\n",
    "$x = \\sin(2\\theta) / 2, y = \\cos(\\theta), \\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ which mathematically define the curve as well as corresponding Python code to plot the curve and the output of that code all within the same notebook:"

The results returned by the computation performed when running the cell are displayed below the cell as the cell _output_, with Jupyter having a _rich display_ system allowing embedding a range of different outputs including for example static images, videos and interactive widgets.\n",

    "### Python interpreters\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative to running Python code via a notebook interface is to run commands in a Python _interpreter_ (also known as an _interactive shell_ or _read-eval-print-loop (REPL)_). This is similar in concept to interacting with your operating system via a command-line interface such as the `bash` or `zsh` shells in Linux and MacOS or `Command Prompt` in Windows. A Python interpreter provides a _prompt_ into which we can type Python code corresponding to commands we wish to execute; we then execute this code by hitting  <kbd>enter</kbd> with any output from the computation being displayed before returning to the prompt again.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not further explore using Python via an interpreter in this course but if you wish to learn more about such command-line interfaces we recommend you attend one of the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) workshops (sessions are regularly organised by [our group](http://rits.github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/software-carpentry/)), which covers this and other skills for computationally based research."

    "### Python libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "A very common requirement in research (and all other!) programming is needing to reuse code in multiple different files. While it may seem that copying-and-pasting is an adequate solution to this problem, this should generally be avoided wherever possible and code which we wish to reuse _factored out_ in to _libraries_ which we we can _import_ in to other files to access the functionality of this code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to copying and pasting code, writing and using libraries has the major advantage of meaning if we spot a bug in the code we only need to fix it once in the underlying library, and we straight away have the fixed code available everywhere the library is used rather than having to separately implement the fix in each file it is used. This similarly applies to for example adding new features to a piece of code. By creating libraries we also make it easier for other researchers to use our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is simple to use libraries within a notebook (and we have already seen examples of this when we imported the Python libraries NumPy and Matplotlib in the figure-eight plot example above), it is non-trivial to use code from one notebook in another without copying-and-pasting. To create Python libraries we therefore generally write the code in to text files with a `.py` extension which in Python terminology are called _modules_ . The code can in these file can then be used in notebooks (or other modules) using the Python `import` statement. For example the cell below creates a file `draw_eight.py` in the same directory as this notebook containing Python code defining a _function_ (we will cover how to define and call functions later in the course) which creates a figure-eight plot and return the figure object."

    "### Python scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "While Jupyter notebooks are a great medium for learning how to use Python and for exploratory work, there are some drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The require Jupyter Lab (or a similar application) to be installed to run the notebook.\n",
    "  * It can be difficult to run notebooks non-interactively, for example when scheduling a job on a cluster [such as those offered by UCL Research Computing](https://www.rc.ucl.ac.uk/docs/Background/Cluster_Computing).\n",
    "  * The flexibility of being able to run the code in cells in any order can also make it difficult to reason how outputs were produced and can lead to non-reproducible analyses.\n",
    "  \n",
    "In some settings it can therefore be preferrable to write Python _scripts_ - that is files (typically with a `.py` extension) which contain Python code which completely describes a computational task to perform and that can be run by  passing the name of the script file to the `python` program in a command-line environment. Optionally scripts may also allow passing in arguments from the command-line to control the execution of the script. As scripts are generally run from text-based terminals, non-text outputs such as images will generally be saved to files on disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python scripts are well suited to for example for describing computationally demanding simulations or analyses to run as long jobs on a remote server or cluster, or tasks where the input and output is mainly at the file level - for instance batch processing a series of data files. We will not cover how to write Python scripts in this course, however you can learn more about this topics in our [MPHY001: _Research software engineering with Python_ course](http://github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/rsd-engineeringcourse/)."

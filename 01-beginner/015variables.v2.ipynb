Python objects come in different types - so far we have encountered both numeric (integer) and textual (string) types - more on this later.",

      "In Jupyter terminology the Python process in which we run the code in a notebook in is termed a _kernel_. The _kernel_ stores the variable names and referenced objects created by any code cells in the notebook that have been previously run. The `Kernel` menu in the menu bar at the top of the JupyterLab interface has an option `Restart kernel...`. Running this will restart the kernel currently being used by the notebook, clearing any currently defined variables and returning the kernel to a 'clean' state. As you cannot restore a kernel once restarted a warning message is displayed asking you to confirm you wish to restart.",

The `Kernel` menu provides an option to restart the current kernel and run all cells in order from top to bottom. If you just want to run a subset of the cells there is also an option to restart and run all cells from the top to the currently selected cell. The commands are useful for checking that a notebook will produce the expected output and run without errors when the cells are executed in order."

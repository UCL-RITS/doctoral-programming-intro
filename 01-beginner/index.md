This is the first part of the *Introduction to research programming with Python* course.

This course teaches the basics of programming using Python with the focus to use it for research. 
It’s aimed at researchers that have no experience of programming – in any language - before. 
If you're already comfortable, with variables, loops, and functions; then this course is not for you.

### This session will cover:

1. The different ways to use Python
2. Basic Python syntax
3. Types and data structures
4. Control flow with conditionals and loops
5. Structuring code with functions and libraries
6. Working with files
7. Basic data visualisation
    
### By the end of this course you will be able to:

1. Use Python from different interfaces
2. Write your own programs that will allow you to repeat an experiment
3. Create functions to be able to reuse it from different programs
4. Read and write data files from a program
5. Visualise your data
6. Understand other programming languages
